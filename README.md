# Intrusion-Detection-System
I have designed an Intrusion detection system using Python, with the help of Open Source Available content from freecodecamp.
The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) I developed is a comprehensive security solution designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real time to detect potential cyber threats. It utilizes **Scapy** to capture packets efficiently, filtering IP and TCP traffic while extracting key flow-based statistics such as **packet count, byte count, TCP flags, and window size**. This data is essential for identifying suspicious patterns and potential intrusions in the network.

The IDS employs a **hybrid detection mechanism**, combining **signature-based detection** and **anomaly-based detection** to enhance accuracy and threat identification. The **signature-based detection** method works by applying predefined rules to recognize well-known attack patterns, such as **SYN floods** (which involve a high rate of SYN requests) and **port scanning** (characterized by a large number of connection attempts with small packet sizes). These rules ensure rapid identification of common cyber threats. On the other hand, the **anomaly-based detection** method utilizes an **Isolation Forest machine learning model**, which is trained on normal network traffic to detect unusual deviations. If network traffic exhibits abnormal characteristics, such as an unusually high packet rate or byte rate, it is flagged as a potential anomaly. This adaptive approach helps in identifying emerging or zero-day threats that do not match predefined signatures.

The IDS also includes a **robust alert system**, which logs detected threats along with relevant details such as the **source and destination IP addresses, ports involved, and confidence levels**. Threats with high confidence scores trigger critical alerts, which can be integrated with external notification systems for immediate response. 

Designed with a **modular architecture**, this IDS ensures scalability and seamless integration with existing security frameworks. By leveraging both rule-based and AI-driven detection techniques, it provides **efficient, proactive network security**, safeguarding systems from evolving cyber threats.
